            <p><strong>Last Updated: <span id="lastUpdated">May 23, 2025</span></strong></p>

            <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
            <p>Welcome to TMV Social ("we," "us," or "our"). We are a marketing agency located in Kearney, Nebraska, USA. We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy notice, or our practices with regards to your personal information, please contact us at info@tmvsocial.com or 308-293-8040.</p>
            <p>This privacy policy applies to all information collected through our website (<a href="https://www.tmvsocial.com">tmvsocial.com</a>), and/or any related services, sales, marketing or events (we refer to them collectively in this privacy policy as the "Services").</p>
            <p>Please read this privacy policy carefully as it will help you understand what information we collect, how we use it, and what rights you have in relation to it.</p>

            <h3>2. What Information Do We Collect?</h3>
            <h4>Personal Information You Disclose to Us</h4>
            <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us.</em></p>

            <p>The personal information that we collect depends on the context of your interactions with us and the Services, the choices you make and the products and features you use. The personal information we collect may include the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contact Data:</strong> Name, email address, phone number, mailing address.</li>

                <li><strong>Client Data:</strong> Information provided by clients for the purpose of marketing services, which may include customer data, campaign performance data, and other business-related information. We process this data as a data processor on behalf of our clients.</li>
                <li><strong>Marketing and Communications Data:</strong> Your preferences in receiving marketing from us and our third parties and your communication preferences.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Information Automatically Collected</h4>
            <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> Some information – such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or browser and device characteristics – is collected automatically when you visit our Services.</em></p>
            <p>We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use or navigate the Services. This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our Services and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our Services, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.</p>
            <p>Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies and similar technologies. You can find out more about this in our <a href="cookie-policy.html">Cookie Policy</a>.</p>

            <h3>3. How Do We Use Your Information?</h3>
            <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We process your information for purposes based on legitimate business interests, the fulfillment of our contract with you, compliance with our legal obligations, and/or your consent.</em></p>
            <p>We use personal information collected via our Services for a variety of business purposes described below:</p>
            <ul>

                <li><strong>To respond to legal requests and prevent harm:</strong> If we receive a subpoena or other legal request, we may need to inspect the data we hold to determine how to respond. We comply with Nebraska and U.S. federal law.</li>
                <li><strong>For other Business Purposes:</strong> Such as data analysis, identifying usage trends, determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns and to evaluate and improve our Services, products, marketing and your experience.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Will Your Information Be Shared With Anyone?</h3>
            <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We only share information with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services, to protect your rights, or to fulfill business obligations.</em></p>
            <p>We may process or share your data that we hold based on the following legal basis:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consent:</strong> We may process your data if you have given us specific consent to use your personal information for a specific purpose.</li>
                <li><strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> We may process your data when it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests.</li>
                <li><strong>Performance of a Contract:</strong> Where we have entered into a contract with you (or our client), we may process your personal information to fulfill the terms of our contract.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal Obligations:</strong> We may disclose your information where we are legally required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena (including in response to public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements).</li>
                <li><strong>Vital Interests:</strong> We may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>More specifically, we may need to process your data or share your personal information in the following situations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may share your data with third-party vendors, service providers, contractors or agents who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. Examples include: payment processing, data analysis, email delivery, hosting services, customer service and marketing efforts.</li>
                <li><strong>Client-Directed Sharing:</strong> As a marketing agency, we share information as directed by our clients in the course of providing our services. This includes sharing data with advertising platforms, analytics providers, and other third parties as necessary to execute marketing campaigns. Our clients are responsible for their own privacy practices regarding the data we process on their behalf.</li>
                <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Do We Use Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies?</h3>
            <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.</em></p>
            <p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information. Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our <a href="cookie-policy.html">Cookie Policy</a>.</p>

            <h3>6. How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</h3>
            <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless otherwise required by law.</em></p>
            <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
            <p>For data processed on behalf of our clients, we retain data according to the client's instructions and our contractual agreements.</p>

            <h3>7. How Do We Keep Your Information Safe?</h3>
            <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</em></p>
            <p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

            <h3>8. What Are Your Privacy Rights?</h3>
            <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time. Depending on your location (e.g., California residents), you may have additional rights.</em></p>
            <p>If you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EEA) or UK, and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. As TMV Social does not operate in the EU/UK, this section may not be directly applicable but is retained for informational purposes. Specific EU/UK data subject rights would be handled on a case-by-case basis if such data processing were to occur.</p>
            <p>If you are a resident in California, you are granted specific privacy rights regarding access to your personal information under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA). This section describes your CCPA/CPRA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.</p>
            <p>Residents of other U.S. states, such as Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, and Utah, may also have specific privacy rights. We will make reasonable efforts to accommodate requests from residents of these states in accordance with applicable laws.</p>
            <p>To exercise your rights, please contact us using the contact details provided below.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Right to Know and Access:</strong> You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to Delete:</strong> You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to Correct:</strong> You have the right to request that we correct inaccurate personal information that we maintain about you.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to Opt-Out of Sale/Sharing:</strong> TMV Social does not "sell" personal information in the traditional sense. However, some data sharing for advertising purposes might be considered "sharing" under CCPA/CPRA. You have the right to opt-out of this. You can contact our info@tmvsocial.com to opt out.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to Non-Discrimination:</strong> We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your privacy rights.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>9. Controls for Do-Not-Track Features</h3>
            <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy policy.</p>

            <h3>10. Children's Privacy</h3>
            <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under the age of 13 (or 16 in some jurisdictions like the EEA/UK or California without parental consent).</em></p>
            <p>Our Services are not directed to children under the age of 13 (or 16 where applicable). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 (or 16). If we learn that personal information from users less than 13 (or 16) years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 13 (or 16), please contact us at info@tmvsocial.com.</p>

            <h3>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We may update this privacy policy from time to time.</em></p>
            <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Last Updated" date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this privacy policy, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy policy frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.</p>
