            <p><strong>Last Updated: <span id="lastUpdated">May 23, 2025</span></strong></p>

            <h3>1. Agreement to Terms</h3>
            <p>These Terms of Service constitute a legally binding agreement made between you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity (“you”) and TMV Social ("we," "us," or "our"), concerning your access to and use of the <a href="https://www.tmvsocial.com">tmvsocial.com</a> website as well as any other media form, media channel, mobile website or mobile application related, linked, or otherwise connected thereto (collectively, the “Site” and "Services"). You agree that by accessing the Site and/or Services, you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by all of these Terms of Service. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, THEN YOU ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM USING THE SITE AND/OR SERVICES AND YOU MUST DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY.</p>
            <p>Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted on the Site from time to time are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes or modifications to these Terms of Service at any time and for any reason. We will alert you about any changes by updating the "Last updated" date of these Terms of Service, and you waive any right to receive specific notice of each such change. It is your responsibility to periodically review these Terms of Service to stay informed of updates. You will be subject to, and will be deemed to have been made aware of and to have accepted, the changes in any revised Terms of Service by your continued use of the Site after the date such revised Terms of Service are posted.</p>

            <h3>2. Services Provided</h3>
            <p>TMV Social provides marketing and advertising services, including but not limited to digital marketing strategy, social media management, content creation, search engine optimization (SEO), pay-per-click (PPC) advertising, and analytics reporting (the "Services"). Specific services to be provided to a client will be outlined in a separate Statement of Work (SOW) or client agreement, which will be governed by these Terms of Service unless explicitly stated otherwise in the SOW.</p>

            <h3>3. Client Responsibilities</h3>
            <p>Clients agree to provide TMV Social with all necessary access to information, data, and accounts required to perform the Services (e.g., website access, social media accounts, analytics platforms). Clients are responsible for the accuracy and legality of all materials and information provided to TMV Social. Clients warrant that they have the right to use any content, trademarks, or other intellectual property provided to us.</p>

            <h3>4. Payment Terms</h3>
            <p>Payment terms for Services will be detailed in the SOW or client agreement. Typically, this may include retainers, project-based fees, or hourly rates. Invoices are payable upon receipt or as otherwise specified. Late payments may incur interest charges at a rate of 1.5% per month or the maximum rate permitted by Nebraska law, whichever is lower. We reserve the right to suspend Services for overdue accounts.</p>

            <h3>5. Intellectual Property Rights</h3>
            <p>Unless otherwise agreed in writing (e.g., in an SOW), TMV Social retains ownership of all pre-existing materials, tools, methodologies, and general know-how. Client-specific deliverables created by TMV Social as part of the Services (e.g., custom ad copy, specific campaign strategies developed for the client) will become the property of the client upon full payment for those deliverables. However, we reserve the right to use non-confidential aspects of the work for our portfolio and marketing purposes after obtaining client consent where appropriate.</p>
            <p>You acknowledge and agree that any questions, comments, suggestions, ideas, feedback or other information regarding the Site or the Services ("Submissions") provided by you to us are non-confidential and shall become our sole property.</p>

            <h3>6. Confidentiality</h3>
            <p>Both parties agree to maintain the confidentiality of any proprietary or sensitive information disclosed during the course of the engagement. This includes business strategies, client lists, financial information, and any data designated as confidential. This obligation will survive the termination of the agreement. Exceptions include information that is publicly known, independently developed, or required to be disclosed by law.</p>

            <h3>7. Term and Termination</h3>
            <p>The term of the agreement will be specified in the SOW. Either party may terminate the agreement with 30 days written notice to the other party. We may terminate the agreement immediately if the client breaches any material term of these Terms of Service or the SOW. Upon termination, the client is responsible for payment of all Services rendered up to the termination date.</p>

            <h3>8. Disclaimer of Warranties</h3>
            <p>THE SITE AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN AS-IS AND AS-AVAILABLE BASIS. YOU AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SITE AND OUR SERVICES WILL BE AT YOUR SOLE RISK. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, IN CONNECTION WITH THE SITE AND THE SERVICES AND YOUR USE THEREOF, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE MAKE NO WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS ABOUT THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE SITE'S CONTENT OR THE CONTENT OF ANY WEBSITES LINKED TO THE SITE AND WE WILL ASSUME NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY (1) ERRORS, MISTAKES, OR INACCURACIES OF CONTENT AND MATERIALS, (2) PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE, OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER, RESULTING FROM YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SITE OR SERVICES, ... (add more standard disclaimer clauses as needed).</p>
            <p>While we strive to achieve client goals, TMV Social does not guarantee specific marketing results, such as increased sales, leads, or search engine rankings, as these are dependent on various factors beyond our direct control, including market conditions and client actions.</p>

            <h3>9. Limitation of Liability</h3>
            <p>IN NO EVENT WILL WE OR OUR DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, OR AGENTS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFIT, LOST REVENUE, LOSS OF DATA, OR OTHER DAMAGES ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SITE OR SERVICES, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, OUR LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE ACTION, WILL AT ALL TIMES BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID, IF ANY, BY YOU TO US DURING THE 6 month PERIOD PRIOR TO ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING (OR, IF NO AMOUNTS PAID, THEN TO $100). CERTAIN US STATE LAWS AND INTERNATIONAL LAWS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES. IF THESE LAWS APPLY TO YOU, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.</p>

            <h3>10. Indemnification</h3>
            <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold us harmless, including our subsidiaries, affiliates, and all of our respective officers, agents, partners, and employees, from and against any loss, damage, liability, claim, or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, made by any third party due to or arising out of: (1) your use of the Services; (2) breach of these Terms of Service; (3) any breach of your representations and warranties set forth in these Terms of Service; (4) your violation of the rights of a third party, including but not limited to intellectual property rights; or (5) any overt harmful act toward any other user of the Site or Services with whom you connected via the Site. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we reserve the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify us, and you agree to cooperate, at your expense, with our defense of such claims.</p>

            <h3>11. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h3>
            <p>These Terms of Service and your use of the Site and Services are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Nebraska applicable to agreements made and to be entirely performed within the State of Nebraska, without regard to its conflict of law principles.</p>
            <p>Any legal action of whatever nature brought by either you or us (collectively, the "Parties" and individually, a "Party") shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in Douglas County, Nebraska, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts.</p>

            <h3>12. Miscellaneous</h3>
            <p>These Terms of Service and any policies or operating rules posted by us on the Site or in respect to the Services constitute the entire agreement and understanding between you and us. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms of Service is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms of Service and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>
